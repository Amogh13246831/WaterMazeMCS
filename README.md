# Morris Water Maze Simulator

A Monte Carlo Simulator of the Morris Water Maze experiment

The Morris Water Maze is used to study spatial learning and memory.

This work aims to build a computational model of the problem-solving behaviour of rats in the maze, through long-term memory consolidation. This model is inspired by the following paper.
https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3736

The code in the MazeModel directory represents our model of next-step evaluation for the platform search.
The code in the MazeBayes directory represents a Bayesian model of next-step evaluation. 

legacy contains the previous versions of the Water Maze Simulator.

All the code is developed by Amogh S Inamdar, Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, under the guidance of Dr. Balaji Jayaprakash, Center for Neuroscience, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
